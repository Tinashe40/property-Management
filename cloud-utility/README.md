This service is part of the Property Management System.

## Description

This project is a utility library that provides common classes and functionalities for other microservices in the system. It includes components for security, JWT handling, data transfer objects (DTOs), and other shared concerns.

## Getting Started

To get the project on your local machine, you can clone the repository using the following command:
